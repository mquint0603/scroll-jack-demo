Next steps:
- Responsive images for breakpoints
     - Maybe feed transformed vids/images into components instead of just the ID
- Style background positions (full-width vs pinned right)
- Style text blocks for each scene
- Implement image sequence - decide which video to do that with
- Hero panel, non-scroll-jacked, with some animations
- Content 
- Prop types
